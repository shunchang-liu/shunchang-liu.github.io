    <h2>Welcome to Shunchang's Blog!</h2>

        I’ve written a few papers before, but to be honest, they just show that I can handle basic research and put together decent summaries. I haven’t really done anything that feels truly satisfying to me yet. What I’m always chasing is research that feels <strong>simple and beautiful</strong>—whether that’s in the ideas, the structure, or how it’s expressed through code, writing, or visuals. I tend to trust my sense of aesthetics, which isn’t fixed—it grows and changes with new experiences and feedback. That’s what keeps me curious and excited to learn. And it’s exactly why I decided to do a PhD—I really want to see how far I can go.

        Some people might say I’m an idealist (I don’t love labels, but fair enough). I like to think of my life as a journey with three stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Making a living:</strong> I’m not super materialistic, but I do want the freedom to try out different lifestyles, maybe study art/music someday if I get the chance. And I want to make sure my loved ones—and myself—don’t have to give up things that matter just because of money.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Being seen:</strong> I hope people remember me—not because I want to be famous, but because I’ve done something meaningful. Recognition isn’t the goal, just something that might come along the way.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Making a difference:</strong> I want to help others—not by giving advice or sharing my story, but by trying to build a world where more people get the chance to shine. A place where everyone can do what they love and become who they want to be.
        </li>
    </ul>
